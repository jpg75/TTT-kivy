TTT-kivy
========

This package implements a simple Agent Based simulation engine to explore a 
set of behavioral economics problems which are tightly related with human 
cognition. 
A prototypical game in this area is a card game called "Target 
The Two", by Cohen & Bacdayan.

The engine is implemented in pure Python on top of the kivy framework.
